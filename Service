1. First check the targetPort of Service(in Service yaml file) should be same as containerPort of pod(in deployment file)
2. We will check whether the service is connected to pod or not using below commands
   kubectl get ep
   kubectl get pod -o wide
3. We will check the pod logs whether the request is landing in to application or not
